1: What is the purpose of this git repository?
This repository contains three projects: One assignment and two labs in which I practiced 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. 

2: Assignment 2 and 3 combined is one of my favorite in class project overall. While I 
can learn the concepts of client and server in class, I never understood how frontend and 
backend interact with each other, how information flows between modules, and where does security
come in so clearly before doing these assignments. Assignments like these also changed my 
mindset with coding once and for all. Before this, I could always go to TAs and office hours
to resolve any problems that come up during implementation. However, web programming has taught me 
the importance of sitting down and spending time googling for the solution. I realized that
one can't know or understand everything and there is bound to be tons of self learning and 
problem solving in order to improve one's skills. These two assignments allowed me to learn 
frameworks, JavaScript, APIs by myself and is truly one of the best learning experiences I've had. 

3: This courses introduced me to coding within the industry. I was able to 
get my first comp sci internship throught the concepts and skills I've gained from it. Like I 
mentioned above, my mindset has grown and I've been introduced to so many fields within the industry that
I'm truly interested in learning more about. 

4: Never trust user input (from lecture).  And really focus on details. (google api takes lat, lng
only as integers if you feed it strings it'll break)

5: Next semester I hope to take operating systems with either security or internet distributed systems.
Later on I will take programming languages, database systems, networks, and a class about user interface.
