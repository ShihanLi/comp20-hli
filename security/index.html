      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I will be exploring security vulnerabilities in a ride hailing service
        website, which stores the username and location information in MongoDB.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="methodology">
      <h1>Methodology</h1>
      <p>
        I used OWASP Zed Attack Proxy to detect the aforementioned
        vulnerabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used curl to insert dangerous data into MongoDB database, hoping to
        explore cross site scripting vulnerabilities and redirect the website to
        another dangerous site.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tested for NoSQL injection by tricking the MongoDB database to return
        all user information by implementing a dangerous command:
        https://secret-peak-95207.herokuapp.com/passenger.json?username[$ne]=JANE
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="abstract">
      <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
      <p>
        I've found that this website is very unsecure and is under high risks of
        exposing user data and prone to attacks. The entire user information
        database can be easily access without proper permission by using a
        simple mongodb api command. The website is also not protected against
        clickjacking, which tricks the user into clicking into a malicious cite
        or software thinking they are doing something else, and cross site
        scripting, which can trigger the website to execute other codes that is
        not programmed by the original programmer. This opens the door to many
        other vulnerabilities through bypassing the security settings the
        developer set.
      </p>

    <div id="issues">
      <h1>Detailed Issues Found</h1>
      <h3>1: NoSQL injection issue</h3>
      <p>
        When query command to the database is not sanitized, it can often
        erroneously trick the database into executing commands that reveals
        userdata or have other security vulnerabilities that the developer
        didn't expect. In this case, the passenger.json route is suppose to only
        return information about the user corresponding to the inputed username
        by the client. However, the [$ne] command in the MongoDB API allows the
        user to find documents whose username is not equal to the inputed
        username. So when I combined this command with a username that I know
        the user has not inputed before, I successfully tricked the database to
        return all entries stored about all of the website's users. This is the
        command that I used:
        https://secret-peak-95207.herokuapp.com/passenger.json?username[$ne]=JANE
      </p>
      <img src="database .png" alt="database" height="66%" width="54%" />
      <br />
      This is an issue with high severity in most times but medium severity in
      this case. If this happens with a database that stores sensitive user data
      such as passwords or bank account information, the exposure of it can have
      dangerous consequences. In this case, the user's ride information would be
      exposed and can be explored to track user location. The developer can
      improve on this using sanitization options such as mongo sanitize. An
      example would be: username: sanitize(request.body.username)
      <h3>2: Clickjacking Vulnerability</h3>
      <p>
        Clickjacking is when an attacker uses multiple layers to trick the user
        to click on a button or a link on another page when they were actually
        intending to click on the top level page. Thus the attacker is hijackign
        the user's click and re routing it to another page possibly containing
        dangerous viruses that can cause damage the the user. This is usually of
        high severity because the attacker can gain sensitive information about
        the user, and gain control to softwares, cameras, and microphones on the
        computer to ceber track the user in the long term.
      </p>
      <img src="clickjacking.png" alt="database" height="66%" width="54%" />
      <p>
        I found this issue through running the OWASP Zad Attack Proxy on the
        url. The developer did not take preventive measures against Clickjacking
        attacks. Thus the attacker can easily trick the user into downloading
        malware or revealing valuable information through Clickjacking. One way
        to defend against this vulnerability is to set X-Frame-Options HTTP
        headers for all pages returned by your web application. Setting it to
        deny will not allow your website to be framed by other domain, thus
        protecting against Clickjacking.
      </p>
      <h3>3: Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability</h3>
      <p>
        Cross site scripting vulnarability is one of the top security risks in
        modern web applications according OWASP top 10 list. It allows the
        attacker to inject client-side scripts into web pages. This is of high
        severity because it can allow the attacker to bypass access controls
        such as the same origin policy designed to protect the user from
        attackes from different domains. Thus it opens the door to many other
        kinds of cyber attacks such as Clickjacking.
      </p>
      <img src="xss.png" alt="database" height="66%" width="54%" />
      <p>
        I found that the developer did not enable web browser XSS protection
        through running the OWASP zed attack proxy on the url. Chrome
        automatically enabled this feature. However, Safari and Internet
        Explorer do not and are thus exposed to cross site scripting attacks. I
        recommend the developer to set this header to the following value, which
        will enable the XSS protection and instruct the browser to block the
        response in the event that a malicious script has been inserted from
        user input, instead of sanitizing: x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block
      </p>

    <div id="conclusion">
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        The cost of improving the security concerns mentioned about is low and
        fast. The developer can consider using free security tools such as OWASP
        ZAP or BurpSuite to self check their work.
